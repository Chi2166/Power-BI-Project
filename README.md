# Power-BI-Project

## Introduction
This is a project based on designing outstanding dashboards through Cleaning, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing insights from the Northwind traderâ€™s dataset using Power BI.

## Problem Statement 
The primary objective of the project was to design and develop a dynamic KPI dashboard using Power BI that would empower the executive team to gain insights into essential aspects of Northwind Traders' operations. The dashboard focused on the following key areas.

-	Average Freight
-	Total quantity
-	Average units sold 
-	Total Discount 
-	Total unit price
-	Quantity by product ID
-	Unit price by product name 
-	Unit price by shipper ID
-	Discount by country
-	Freight by Category name 
-	Quantity per unit by month.
  
These insights would assess the company's financial health, identify emerging patterns, and make strategic decisions accordingly. 

To ensure data accuracy, we thoroughly cleaned it by removing spaces, duplicates, and errors. These are the images from the data-cleaning process.

## Discussion

To accomplish the project objectives, I leveraged Power BI's robust capabilities to transform raw data into interactive visualizations. The development process involved the following steps:

### Design and Visualization

Using Power BI's intuitive interface, I designed a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard layout. I selected appropriate charts, graphs, and visual elements to represent key performance indicators effectively. The dashboard accommodates evolving data and enables easy exploration and filtering for deeper insights which laid emphasis on discount by country, average freight, quantity per unit by month, quantity by product ID, Unit price by product, and shipper's ID.

### Data Modeling and Analysis

I created data models in Power BI, establishing relationships between different datasets. This enabled cross-referencing and facilitated comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions. Advanced analytical techniques, such as time series analysis, segmentation, and statistical calculations, were applied to extract meaningful insights.

### Insights and Recommendations
Alongside building the dashboard, I performed rigorous analysis to generate valuable insights. I formulated actionable recommendations for the executive team by combining data-driven findings with domain knowledge. These recommendations aimed to optimize product strategies, enhance product offerings, strengthen customer relationships, and streamline logistics operations.

### Product Performance

Offering a comprehensive view of the performance of various gourmet food products supplied by Northwind Traders. The dashboard highlighted, unit price by product name, quantity by product ID, product category trends, and profitability analysis, facilitating product portfolio management and identifying opportunities for improvement.

### Sum and Average
Identifying and profiling Northwind Traders' most valuable customers, enabling the executive team to understand customer preferences, analyze purchase patterns, and develop strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and retention. The dashboard provided crucial information such as total quantity, total unit price, total discount, average cost of freight, average quantity per unit sold, average by product ID, unit price by product name, unit price by shipper ID, discount by country, freight by category name, quantity per unit by month.

### Unit Price
Evaluating unit price and their impact on the company's profitability. The dashboard displayed unit price trends, comparisons between different products, and shipper ID with high shipping expenses. These insights assisted in optimizing logistics and reducing operational costs.

## Conclusion
The Northwind Challenge provided an exciting opportunity to showcase my expertise as a BI Developer. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I successfully built a dynamic KPI dashboard that can empower Northwind Traders to monitor and understand the company's performance across critical areas. The dashboard can facilitate data-driven decision-making, allowing them to stay ahead of market trends, seize opportunities, and address challenges effectively.
